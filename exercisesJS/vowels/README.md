# Vowels

For this exercise, consider "Y" to be a consonant.

* Write a command line application that takes one word as an argument. 
* If the word has more than one vowel log "It checks out."
* If the word has more than one vowel AND no vowels are adjacent log "It checks out", otherwise log "nope".
* For example, "Eat" returns "nope", "Ate" returns "It checks out"
* Instead of logging "It checks out", log the consonants in the word.

HINT: remember to put your argument in after running your javascript file. Your command line should look similar to this:

```
	node vowels.js ate
	// It checks out
	// your consonants are t
```
