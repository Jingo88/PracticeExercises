# Vowels

For this exercise, consider "Y" to be a consonant.

* Write a command line application that takes one word as an argument. 
* If the word has more than one vowel log "It checks out."
* If the word has more than one vowel AND no vowels are adjacent log "It checks out", otherwise log "nope".
* For example, "Eat" returns "nope", "Ate" returns "It checks out"

HINT: Remember to put your argument in after running your javascript file. Your command line should look similar to this:

```
	node vowels.js ate
	// It checks out
```

BONUS: Also console.log "your consonants are..." and print out the consonants in the word

HINT 2: The answers are given in two different ways. After you are done completing the exercises take a look. Although the useSwitch file is longer than the useIfElse file it contains less characters.
