# Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is an infinite sequence where each element in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. For example the first two numbers are 0 and 1; the first five numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.

Write a command line application that logs the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence under 100.

Bonus: Instead have the application take a number as an argument and prints out that number of elements in the sequence.

HINT: You should put a limit on how high the user could make their number.
