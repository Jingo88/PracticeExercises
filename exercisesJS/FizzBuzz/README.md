#FizzBuzz

Write a command line application that takes one integer as an argument. If the argument is devisible by 3 return "Fizz", if the argument is divisible by 5 return "Buzz", and if the argument is divisible by both 3 and 5 return "FizzBuzz". Otherwise return just the argument itself. 

HINT: The modulo operator may come in handy.
