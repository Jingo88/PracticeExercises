#FizzBuzz

**Cheatsheet**

In javascript there exists the remainder operator ```%``` to grab the remainder when one number is divided by another.

For instance ```12 % 5``` is ```2```, because ```5``` goes into ```12``` twice with one remainder of two.

Note: the remainder operator is sometimes called the modulo operator.

**Challenge**:

Write a program in javascript that takes one integer as an argument. If the argument is divisible by 3 return "Fizz", if the argument is divisible by 5 return "Buzz", and if the argument is divisible by both 3 AND 5 return "FizzBuzz". Otherwise return just the argument itself.  

Hint: if a number is perfectly divisible by another number it has a remainder of zero.
